    <h1>RepOne Set Metrics</h1>
The RepOne app comes with several metrics and convenient ways to view your data. They mostly consist of what we call ‘Set Metrics’ or metrics that are a result of a finished set, ideally of multiple reps. For example, ‘Shortest ROM’ immediately puts the smallest Range of Motion front and center at the top of the set, which can give you information about your highest squat at a glance. Several of our customers also use either minimum or maximum Average Set Velocity as their main metric for autoregulation, and that can be set to your Big Set Metric and highlighted in red.

<p style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Note: All valid set metrics are listed below, if you select a combination of metrics that is not listed here the app will default to a valid metric instead.</p>

<h2>Average Velocity</h2>
<p><b>Average Set Velocity</b> This is an average of average velocities for the entire set. Average Set Velocity is a good indicator of fatigue throughout a workout, as it takes into account data from every rep of a set, and can be easily compared to previous Average Set Velocities.</p>
<p><b>Absolute Average Velocity Loss</b> This is an average of average velocities for the entire set. Average Set Velocity is a good indicator of fatigue throughout a workout, as it takes into account data from every rep of a set, and can be easily compared to previous Average Set Velocities.</p>
<p><b>Set Average Velocity Loss</b> This is the difference between the first and last average velocity of a set. </p>
<p><b>Percent Average Velocity Loss</b> This is the difference between the fastest and slowest average velocity of a set, displayed as a percentage.</p>
<p><b>First Rep Average Velocity</b> First Rep Average Velocity is the average velocity of the first rep of a set. It’s a popular metric to autoregulate intensity, as it indicates an athletes strength level immediately after a rest period.</p>
<p><b>Last Rep Average Velocity</b> Last Rep Average Velocity is the average velocity of the very last rep of a set. It’s a very common metric for autoregulating intensity, as it has been shown in research to be tightly correlated with set RPE and linearly proportional to absolute strength.</p>
<p><b>Minimum Average Velocity</b> Minimum Average Velocity is the lowest recorded average velocity of a set. It’s used in a similar manner to Last Rep Average Velocity.</p>
<p><b>Maximum Average Velocity</b> Maximum Average Velocity is the fastest average velocity of a set. It is used in a similar manner to First Rep Average Velocity.</p>
<p><b>Slowest Ever Average Velocity</b> This metric is the slowest average velocity ever recorded at the exercise, weight, and rep range logged in each set. Your slowest velocity should decrease over time as you gain technical proficiency and lean body mass.</p>
<p><b>Fastest Ever Average Velocity</b> This metric is the fastest average velocity ever recorded at the exercise, weight, and rep range logged in each set. This is useful as a measure of improvement in strength and power output over time.</p>
<p><b>Peak-End Average Velocity</b> This metric is the average of the last average velocity and the slowest average velocity of a set. This is useful as a representation of effort, as people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (in this case, slowest) and at its end (the last rep). We think this will correlate more closely to perceived exertion than last rep velocity.</p>

<h2>Peak Velocity</h2>
<p><b>Average Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the average of all of your Peak Velocities recorded during your set. </p>
<p><b>Absolute Peak Velocity Loss</b> This metric is the difference between the fastest and slowest peak velocities in your set. </p>
<p><b>Set Peak Velocity Loss</b> This metric is the difference between the first and last peak velocities in your set. </p>
<p><b>Percent Peak Velocity Loss</b> This is the difference between the fastest and slowest peak velocities of a set, displayed as a percentage. </p>
<p><b>First Rep Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the Peak Velocity of the first rep of a set. </p>
<p><b>Last Rep Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the Peak Velocity of the last rep of a set. </p>
<p><b>Minimum Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the slowest Peak Velocity of a set. </p>
<p><b>Maximum Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the fastest Peak Velocity of a set. </p>
<p><b>Fastest Ever Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the fastest Peak Velocity ever recorded at the exercise, weight, and rep range logged in each set. This is useful as a measure of improvement in strength and power output over time. </p>
<p><b>Slowest Ever Peak Velocity</b> This metric is the slowest Peak Velocity ever recorded at the exercise, weight, and rep range logged in each set. Your slowest velocity should decrease over time as you gain technical proficiency and lean body mass. </p>
<p><b>Peak-end Peak Velocity</b> Peak-End Peak Velocity is the average of the slowest peak velocity and the last peak velocity of a set. If you like to use peak velocity as a representation of perceived effort, this can be more accurate than using either the last or the slowest peak velocity to make training decisions. </p>

<h2>Range of Motion</h2>
<p><b>Absolute ROM Loss</b> This metric calculates the difference between your longest and shortest ROM in each set. </p>
<p><b>Set ROM Loss</b> This metric calculates the difference between your first and last ROM in each set. </p>
<p><b>Percent ROM Loss</b> This is the difference between the largest and smallest range of motion of a set, displayed as a percentage. </p>
<p><b>First Rep ROM</b> This metric is the range of motion of the first rep of your set. </p>
<p><b>Last Rep ROM</b> This metric is the range of motion of the last rep of your set. </p>
<p><b>Minimum ROM</b> This metric is the shortest range of motion of your set. </p>
<p><b>Maximum ROM</b> This metric is the longest range of motion of your set. </p>
<p><b>Peak-End ROM</b> Peak-End ROM is the average of the shortest ROM and the last ROM of a set. </p>

<h2>RPE</h2>
<p><b>RPE</b> RPE only has one Set Metric, which is Set RPE. This is because individual reps don’t have an RPE rating. </p>
