    <h1>RepOne Software Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We at Red Matter Labs, Inc. (“Red Matter Labs”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Red Matter Labs in connection with our hardware device (called “RepOne Device”), our apps available through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store (collectively called “App”), and our virtual coaching service (referred to as “Service”). For the purposes of this document, the App and the virtual coaching interface are collectively called “Platform.”</p>

    <p>By visiting our Website and/or using our Services on the Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>The Information We Collect</p>

    <p>1. Personal Information</p>

    <p>If you elect to sign in to the Platform using Google, you are authorizing Red Matter Labs to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Google, Inc. (“Google”) could provide to Red Matter Labs through Google’s Application Programming Interface (“API”). Such information may include, without limitation, your identifier, access token, and e-mail address.</p>

    <p>All information collected pursuant to this section is collectively referred to as “Personal Information.” We do not collect or access any Personal Information from you when you use the Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily or authorize us to access it.</p>

    <p>2. Lifting Metrics</p>

    <p>The Platform provides you with high quality lifting data. In order to provide visualization of such data, we collect multiple metrics from the RepOne Device through BlueTooth. The metrics may include, without limitation, velocity, positional data, and range of motion. The Red Matter Labs Platform also calculates and collects relevant metrics, which may include, without limitation, rest times, set numbers, and rep numbers. All metrics mentioned in this section are collectively called the “Lifting Metrics.”</p>

    <p>On Android specifically, location data is required for the BlueTooth connection to the RepOne Device to operate. We do not collect, store, or share the geolocation information of our users.</p>

    <p>3. Workout Information</p>

    <p>To help organize your Lifting Metrics, we collect additional information that you voluntarily provide to us. These include, without limitation, exercise names, RPE, weights, tags, and deleted reps. In addition, we also collect information about the Mobile Device that logged the Lifting Metrics, such as the platform (e.g., iOS or Android) and the version of the App. Such information is collectively called the “Workout Information.”</p>

    <p>4. Activity Information</p>

    <p>We may collect activity and usage information occurring via the Platform, collectively called the “Activity Information”. Such information may include, without limitation, modifying Settings, connecting to an RepOne Device, switching between tabs, editing a set, ending a set, ending a workout, using filters, and syncing with the cloud.</p>

    <p>5. Other Information</p>

    <p>We may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include tokens to assist in 3rd party services such as push notifications.</p>

    <p>How We Use the Information</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs uses the data we collect to operate our business, provide our products and Services, improve existing products and services, develop new products and services, and to improve and personalize your experiences interacting with us. Some examples of the use of the data may include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using Personal Information to allow our Platform to associate your data with your account.</li>
    <li>With your permission, use Personal Information to assist you in your request (e.g., switching email addresses, updating data, removing data).</li>
    <li>Applying Lifting Metrics and Workout Information to machine learning algorithms to test assumptions and to gain data science insights.</li>
    <li>Using Activity Information to help guide future direction, design, and development.</li>
    <li>Using Other Information to assist in 3rd party services such as push notifications.</li>
</ul>
    <p>How We Share the Information</p>

    <p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include data science collaborations (Lifting Metrics and Workout Information), coaching (Personal Information, Lifting Metrics, and Workout Information), providing marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.</p>

    <p>With your permission, third-party applications or services may access your Personal Information. For example, you may export CSVs to Google Drive. We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your Personal Information with other websites and services, such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.</p>

    <p>We may share some or all of your Information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us.</p>

    <p>As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

    <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fitocracy or others.</p>

    <p>How We Protect Your Information</p>

    <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.</p>

    <p>Protection of certain Personally Identifying Information</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Red Matter Labs’s behalf or to provide services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Red Matter Labs, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Red Matter Labs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Red Matter Labs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Red Matter Labs, third parties, or the public at large.</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

    <p>Data Retention</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs will retain your Personal Information and Other Information for as long as you maintain an Account or as needed to provide you the Services. We will also retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <p>Red Matter Labs will retain your anonymous Lifting Metrics, Workout Information, and Activity Information indefinitely.</p>

    <p>Important Notice to Non-US Residents</p>

    <p>It is important to note that the Platform and its servers are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Platform and by providing us Personal Information when using our Services, you hereby consent to this transfer and our use of the information and data provided by you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Children</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Platform. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through the Platform without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

    <p>Third Parties We Don’t Own or Control</p>

    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. For example, if you download one of our applications on your smartphone, the manufacturer of your smartphone may have a policy that applies to its own practices for collecting information through that smartphone. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every device, website, and service that you use.</p>

    <p>External Websites</p>

    <p>The Platform may contain links to third-party websites. Red Matter Labs has no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites to which we provide links. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.</p>

    <p>Changes to This Privacy Policy</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. By accessing the Platform and/or using the Services after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the Information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
